 Ideas: 

Maps for different audiences: adults versus children? 

Adult + look at the tone 

Accessibility considerations? 

Look in accessibility related stuff 

Web vs mobile? 

Website but optimized for phone + tablets 

Scavenger hunt? 

Nice to have but not necessity 

Front-end first vs back-end first? 

 Both at the same time 

Map updating for museum staff without needing coding experience? Maybe a login that lets you update the text/pictures? Not sure how difficult this is, something to maybe consider 

Look into files they can change, without having to change the code, update the file, reupload it then done - > XML
